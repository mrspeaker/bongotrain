* Bongo x Bongo

Welcom to bongo.

** Bongo x Bongo
A trainer for Bongo, including a new game mode: OGNOB MODE.

** Disassembly
Fully annotated version of the Bongo source code. I did this the super-worst way: just search-replacing addresses in a text document. However, it should be trivial to turn this into real source code that can re-build the official ROMs. (And now that I've typed that sentance, I'm keen to do it).
