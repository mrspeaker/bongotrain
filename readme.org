* Bongo x Bongo

Welcom to Bongo x Bongo by [[https://www.mrspeaker.net][Mr Speaker]].

- =bongo.asm= : annotated assembly source code for Bongo.
- =bongo.lua= : trainer and new game mode for MAME Bongo.
- =dump/= : original ROM bin files
   - =bongoa/= : the new "Set 2" ROMs
   - =bongo/= :  the original and best Bongo ROMs.
- =old/= : my original attempts at reversing Bongo
- =readme.org= : these words you're reading right now
- =tools/= :  extra bits (zmac and a gfx dumper)
- =zout/= : build folder for freshly assembled ROMs

** Bongo x Bongo
[[https://github.com/mrspeaker/bongotrain/blob/main/bongo.lua][bongo.lua]] is a trainer for Bongo, including a new game mode: OGNOB MODE.
See the =RUNNING= section in the file for instructions (tl;dr:  =mame bongo --autoboot_script ./bongo.lua=)

** Reverse-engineered source code
[[https://github.com/mrspeaker/bongotrain/blob/main/bongo.asm][bongo.asm]] is a decompiled and annotated version of the Bongo object code back to source code.
I used AI to generate the symbols and subroutine names. Did I say AI? I meant I tediously poured over the listing, manually search-replacing symbols as I figured out what they were for.

Not 100% complete... still a bunch of placeholder symbols, but I found so much interesting stuff buried in the code... blog posts to come!

** Building ROMs
The Bongo source can be compiled with the [[http://48k.ca/zmac.html][zmac]] z80 compiler, then split into chunks that recreate the 6 original Bongo ROM files. The output is a set of MAME-exact ROMS (i.e.; they have the correct CRCs) 

[[https://github.com/mrspeaker/bongotrain/blob/main/build.sh][build.sh]] compiles the source with =zmac=. The output file is split into 4k chunks, and each chunk compared against the origin ROM dumps to make sure nothing has been broken. It's then zipped up into =zout/bongo.zip= that can be run in MAME.

If you change bytes, the CRCs will fail - but you can still get a bootleg build of Bongo... why not make your very own version?

** TODOs
Although most of the larger structure has been reversed, there are still heaps of unknown/unspecified symbols and addresses.

Also, the audio routines have not been figured out at all... they are mostly towards the end of the file, and contain a lot of data. I'm not sure about the format of it, so I can't just squish it all into db's: there is obviously lots of "note" data, but also there are a lot of indirect address jumps: which is hard to verify. The best way is look at `bongo.lst` as you need to know where the addresses jump to!

** BONGOA: Bongo Set 2
A new bongo set came out - which was exciting... buuut, spoilers: absolutely nothin' in it.

I did a diff between the old roms and the new roms: only a handful of bytes different, and only a couple look like they do anything at all.

Changes in two roms:
#+BEGIN_SRC
bg1.bin -> 1-2532.bin
bg2.bin -> 3-2532.bin
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC
cmp -l -x zout/bg1.bin dump/bongoa/1-2532.bin
00000b40 00 a7
00000b41 00 c0
00000b42 00 f5
00000b43 00 3e
00000b44 00 ff
00000b45 00 32
00000b47 00 b8
00000b48 00 f1
00000b49 00 c9
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC
cmp -l -x zout/bg3.bin dump/bongoa/3-2532.bin
00000288 3e c9
0000042c cd c9
#+END_SRC

Total of 11 bytes changed. no new game modes, or gfx changes or anything :(

There were also bytes added at 0xb40:
#+BEGIN_SRC
a7         and a
c0         ret nz
f5         push af
3e ff      ld a,$ff
32 00 b8   ld ($B800),a
f1         pop af
c9         ret
#+END_SRC

Previously at this location it was just nops.. in my disassembly I had:
#+BEGIN_SRC
;; 70 zeros/nops. That's a lotta nops. (free bytes?)
dc 70,$0
#+END_SRC

Looks like somone thought the same and put that routine there.
Thing is, it's loaded at 0x0b40... but nothing ever calls that :(

in rom 3: 00000288 3e -> c9 (ret

#+BEGIN_SRC
